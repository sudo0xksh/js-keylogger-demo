# ⌨️ JS Key Event Demo (LAB)

JS Key Event Demo is a simple browser-based project that demonstrates
how keyboard events can be captured using JavaScript.

This project is intended strictly for **learning and lab environments**.

---

## Overview

Keyboard events are commonly used in frontend applications for:
- User input handling
- Shortcuts
- Accessibility features
- Form interactions

At the same time, understanding key events is important from a
**security and awareness perspective**.

This demo shows how easily key presses can be detected using JavaScript.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Listening to keyboard events
- Capturing pressed keys
- Logging key values in real time
- Understanding DOM event handling

The goal is awareness and learning — not misuse.

---

## How It Works

- A basic input field is displayed on the page
- A global `keydown` event listener is attached
- Every key pressed by the user is logged to the browser console

---

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Click inside the input field
4. Start typing
5. Observe key values in the console

---

## Important Notice

This project is for **educational purposes only**.

- Do NOT use this technique to capture sensitive input
- Do NOT deploy this on real websites
- Use only in controlled or lab environments

---

## Learning Outcome

This project helps you understand:
- Keyboard event handling in JavaScript
- DOM event listeners
- How user input can be observed
- Why client-side input monitoring should be handled responsibly

---

## Final Thoughts

Not all security issues start on the server.
Some start right at the keyboard.

Understanding how input is handled
is the first step toward securing it.
